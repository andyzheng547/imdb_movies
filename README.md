# IMDB Movies

Welcome to IMDB Movies. This is a Ruby gem that works through CLI. It pulls the info for top current and upcoming films on IMDB's website. Use the CLI to navigate and display information about films you are curious about. Want to see the trailer? We can show it to you.

## Usage

When loaded, the movies will display in 3 categories: Opening This Week, Now Playing, and Coming Soon. The CLI works through text input and is not case sensitive.

The program only displays the first 5 movies in each category if available. To see more movies, enter '1' or 'opening this week', '2' or 'now playing' and '3' or 'coming soon'. I personally recommend '1/2/3'.

To display information about a movie that you are interested in, enter the movie name. It can be a section of the full movie name. 
Example: 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' can be listed with 'star wars'.

After the movie's info is displayed you have the option of watching the Youtube trailer if you are interested. Just enter 'y' or 'yes' when asked.

When you are done, simple type 'exit' or 'quit' to leave the application.
